### Classically
$$U = -\vec{\mu} \cdot \vec{B}$$ 

### Quantum Physics
$$\vec{\mu} = g \frac{e}{2mc}\vec{S}.$$

where $\mu_0 = (e\hbar)/(2mc)$ is a quantity called the magneton

The "Bohr Magneton" has $m = m_e$ and has a value of $5.8 \times 10^-15$ $\mathrm{MeV/G}$. 

The "nuclear magneton" has $m = m_p$ with a value of $3.15 \times 10^-18$ $\mathrm{MeV/G}$.

Transition from one state to another in QM satisfies
$$N(t) = N(0)\mathrm{exp}(-t/\tau), \tau = t_{1/2}/(\mathrm{ln}2).$$

For an energy eigenstate

$$<t|\psi> = \psi(0)exp(-t\;E(t) \; / \;\hbar).$$
