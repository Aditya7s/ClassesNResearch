Nuclear: $10^{-3} m_pc^2 < KE < 10^2m_pc^2$ 
Particle: $m_p c^2 < KE < 10^4 m_p c^2$

>Particle physics is always done at relativistic energies, so a Lorentz covariant description must be used. This is used for kinematics as well as dynamics.

A "manifestly covariant" approach uses Lorentz scalars (aka world scalars) and four-vectors only.

World-scalar exampe: mass, charge, other intrinsic particle properties, and fundamental constants such as $\hbar$ and $c$.

Four-vector notation is denoted as:

$x_\mu = (ct,\textbf{r}), x^\mu = (ct, \textbf{-r})$.
