# Parity: 
$$\mathcal{P} \:\Psi(\textbf{r},t) = \Psi(-\textbf{r},t)$$


There are two types of vectors: Polar and Axial

Axial Vector --> Angular Momentum $$\vec{L} = \vec{r} \times \vec{p}$$
Polar Vector --> W and Z bosons


Charge Conjugation: $$\mathcal{C}\ket{\mathcal{A}} = \ket{-\mathcal{A}} $$
Where $\mathcal{A}$ is the set of all additive quantum numbers in the system


## Time Reversal
$$\mathcal{T}\Psi(\textbf{r},t) = \Psi^* (\textbf{r},-t).$$
It can be shown with essentially no 

You can take QFT and turn it into an axiomatic mathematical system, and prove theorems in that system, like you prove theorems in mathematics.

In axiomatic QFT you can axiomatically prove the relationship between spin and energy. Half energy spin is to boson, etc.
